# chat-app-1
This real-time chat app uses the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The React front-end ensures a smooth, responsive interface, while Node.js and Express handle the back-end and authentication. With Socket.io for real-time messaging and MongoDB for storing chats, it supports private/group chats, notifications, and online status.
